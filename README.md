Converts plain text into audio with the Google Translate URL

# What?
You can use the Google Translator URL to convert plain text into audio in seconds.

# How?
It's easy. This is the url: http:translate.google.com/translate_tts?tl=&q=

- 'tl' is the lang. 
  Ex: tl=en.
- 'q' is the plain text.
  Ex: q=hello world.

This is an example to test the service:
<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate_tts?tl=en&q=hello%20world">Click here</a>
